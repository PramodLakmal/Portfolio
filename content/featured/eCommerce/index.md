A scalable eCommerce platform built using a microservices architecture to ensure high performance and maintainability. This project consists of multiple services, including Users, Products, and Orders, each following different architectural patterns. It utilizes RabbitMQ for event-driven communication, Ocelot as an API Gateway, and Azure DevOps for CI/CD automation. The system is containerized with Docker and orchestrated using Kubernetes for efficient deployment and scalability.
